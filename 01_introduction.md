# Introduction to the Module

In this module, you will learn to answer questions with data using SQL. 

SQL is an essential tool in the arsenal of both data engineers and data analysts.
Why? Because most data is stored in databases and the most popular databases are relational.
SQL has relatively simple syntax, yet it's employed by the world's largest companies to solve incredibly challenging problems.

In this module, you will learn how to use SQL to access, transform and summarise data stored in a SQL database by working on small to medium datasets first.

Then, you'll work on a business scenario that will require you to write SQL queries to process data from a large application database and build an analytics dashboard to visualise how key business metrics change over time.

## SQL for Data Processing and Analytics 

You've likely already encountered SQL in software development, where it's mainly used for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations - for example, for creating a new row in a table when a user signs up, reading rows from a table when the user wants access to information, updating a row when a user modifies their data, and delete data, for example when a user deletes their account.

In the context of data engineering and analysis, SQL tends to be used a bit differently: instead of retrieving a small number of rows at any one time, SQL scripts for data processing typically involve reading, cleaning, and analysing data stored across many rows and many tables at once.

SQL is often the most efficient way of processing large amounts of data and this is the main job of a data engineer. 
What makes it efficient is that when we use SQL, we don't have to copy the raw data out of the database first to then load it into another application to process it - instead, we let the database itself do the heavy lifting by expressing our data processing logic in SQL.

Depending on the task at hand, SQL can replace the use of a Python data analysis library (like pandas) entirely or be used to pre-process data and condense it before loading into an analysis tool.

## Key terms

* **SQL**  
  (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing data in a relational database. It was developed in the 1970s and is the most common method of accessing data in databases today. SQL has a variety of functions that allow its users to read, manipulate, and change data. 
* **Aggregation**  
  Aggregation in data processing refers to the process of transforming a set of data values into a single value that summarises or "aggregates" the information in the set. This is often done to obtain a summary or overall view of the data.

  For example, in a dataset containing the sales of a retail store, aggregation could be used to determine the total sales for a particular month or quarter, the average sales per day, the total number of items sold, or the most popular item sold.

  Aggregation reduces the volume of data and makes it more manageable. By aggregating data, it becomes possible to perform operations such as data visualization, data analysis, and modeling, which would be infeasible with the original data.
  SQL is especially useful for performing aggregation tasks over large volumes of data stored in a database.
